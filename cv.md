### **Info about me:**

##### The goal of my studies at ***rs school*** is to gain practical skills in front-end development. I started to get interested in programming 1-1.5 years ago. I remember how I downloaded a couple of books about HTML, CSS on my phone and began to study. I realized that I need practice to consolidate my knowledge. The whole educational process was on me. I never took courses.

### **Skills:**

##### - HTML
##### - CSS/SCSS
##### - bad JS
##### - use VSCode

### **My first project**
##### The first task I chose for myself was to develop a website for my father's work. I uploaded this site to free hosting.
##### You can visit this site, maybe it will make you laugh. http://k95095ps.beget.tech/
##### When creating the site, I ran into problems, the solution of which I gradually found on the Internet. List of tasks that I had to solve:
##### - add Yandex map with a marker to the adress of the office location
##### - modal window
##### - adaptive layot for mobile phone (not tablet)
##### - js form validation (name and number phone)
##### - sending message to the e-mail (you can submit the form and i will recieve it on the mail indicated in the contacts)
