### **Info about me:**

##### The goal of my studies at ***rs school*** is to gain practical skills in front-end development. I started to get interested in programming 1-1.5 years ago. I remember how I downloaded a couple of books about HTML, CSS on my phone and began to study. I realized that I need practice to consolidate my knowledge. 

### **Skills:**

##### * HTML
##### * CSS/SCSS
##### * bad JS
##### * use VSCode

### **Code example:**

##### *You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not*
``` javascript
function check(a, x) {
// your code here
return a.includes(x)
}
```

### **My first project**
##### The first task I chose for myself was to develop a website for my father's work. I uploaded this site to free hosting.
##### You can visit this site, maybe it will make you laugh. http://k95095ps.beget.tech/
##### When creating the site, I ran into problems, the solution of which I gradually found on the Internet. List of tasks that I had to solve:
##### - add Yandex map with a marker to the adress of the office location
##### - modal window
##### - adaptive layot for mobile phone (not tablet)
##### - js form validation (name and number phone)
##### - sending message to the e-mail (you can submit the form and i will recieve it on the mail indicated in the contacts)
#### I never realized this project, as a very important criterion was SEO, which I had not yet mastered.

### **The whole educational process was on me. I never took courses.**

### **Languages:**
##### English - A2
